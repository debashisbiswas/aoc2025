# Advent of Code 2025

https://adventofcode.com/2025

The goal for this year is to finish all the challenges. This should be easier
now that the number of challenges has been reduced to 12 this year. In service
of this goal, I am using TypeScript rather than trying to complete the
challenges in a language I am unfamiliar with. Learning new languages is fun,
but would likely add too much friction to me completing all challenges.

Not using LLMs to solve the problems directly, but still using them to ask
specific questions, such as "why doesn't TypeScript infer the correct return
type when I'm returning an object property with a narrowed type"?
