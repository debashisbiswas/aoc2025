Kept it simple from the beginning and it made the changes from part 2 easier.
Good abstractions are nice, but they're so short-lived for these challenges that
it's often not worth it. On the other hand, maybe it'd be interesting to
consider how well you can build an abstraction in the first part that is
resilient to the changes introduced in the second part.

I should consider regex as a solution more often.
